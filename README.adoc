This mod adds VR to Unity games. While the aim is to make it work with any Unity game, the primary focus right now is as a support utility for the Techtonica VR mod and won't achieve great results out of the box. It is intended to be used by modders to add VR support games in conjunction with their own mod.

== Prerequisites

* Version {game-version} of the game. As the game is still in early access, this mod may not work with future versions of the game. If you encounter any issues, please create an https://github.com/{repo}/issues[Issue].

== Setup

This mod assumes you are a developer or familiar with BepInEx and modding in general. If you are using this mod as basis for your own please package it in a way that users don't have to come here to figure out how to install it.

If you are a user, please ask the mod author to provide a more user-friendly installation guide or use a mod manager that can install dependencies.

=== Dependencies
The github release bundles the dependencies with the mod. The thunderstore release does not include the dependencies. You need to install them separately or use a mod manager that can install dependencies.

==== PiUtils (Required)

== Configuration
The configuration file is located in `BepInEx/config/de.xenira.pi_vr_loader.cfg`. You can edit it using a text editor like Notepad.

=== Resetting the Configuration
To reset the configuration, delete the `de.xenira.pi_vr_loader.cfg` file in the `BepInEx/config` folder. The mod will create a new configuration file with the default values the next time you run the game.
